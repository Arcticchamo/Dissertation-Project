My Dissertation, titled "An examination of how artificial pets affect a player's emotion and influence behaviour within a game", was based on the research of AI animals within games, specifically companions. The focus of my study was to learn how developers utilise animal companions to create a virtual bond between the player and AI.
With the study, I attempted to create a game where the users would spend time taking care of a virtual hamster. This would required feeding, watering, cleaning and interactions to keep the hamster happy. The AI itself built upon the PAD Emotional State System to allow emotional changes with the hamster.
